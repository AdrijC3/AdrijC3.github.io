# Welcome!

Hi! I'm **Adrij**, a third-year PhD student in Labor Economics at the University of Luxembourg, working under the supervision of Prof. Konstantinos Tatsiramos.

My research interests include labor economics, mobility, health and development, with a focus on applied microeconometrics. I use causal inference techniques to evaluate public policies such as unemployment insurance and healthcare user fee exemptions.

Feel free to explore my research. 

To get in touch, you can reach me at adrij[dot]chakraborty[at]uni[dot]lu.
