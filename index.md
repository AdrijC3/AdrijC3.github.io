# Welcome!

Hi! I'm **Adrij**, a third-year PhD student in Labor Economics at the University of Luxembourg, working under the supervision of Prof. Konstantinos Tatsiramos.

This fall, Iâ€™ll be joining the Department of Spatial Economics at VU Amsterdam as a postdoctoral researcher.

My research interests include labor economics, mobility, health and development, with a focus on applied microeconometrics. I use causal inference to evaluate public policies such as unemployment insurance and user fee exemptions in healthcare.
