<h1 style="color: #0366d6;">Welcome!</h1>

I'm **Adrij**, a PhD student at the University of Luxembourg, working under the supervision of Prof. Konstantinos Tatsiramos.

My research interests include labor economics, mobility, health and development, with a focus on applied microeconometrics. I use causal inference techniques to evaluate public policies such as unemployment insurance and healthcare user fee exemptions.

Feel free to get in touch! You can reach me at adrij[dot]chakraborty[at]uni[dot]lu.
